### Hi there üëã I'm Shangari (she/her)

**My Mindset**
- I believe we make our own luck if we stay at it long enough
- I prefer to live in the moment and be free and to flow and to be happy.
- I love being wrong because that means in that instant, I learned something new that day.

**My Favourite quotes**
- Knowledge is a skyscraper. You can take a shortcut with a fragile foundation of memorization, or build slowly upon a steel frame of understanding.
- Trade money for time, not time for money. You‚Äôre going to run out of time first.
- Ego is false confidence, self-respect is true confidence.

**My Learnings**
- Microeconomics
- Game theory
- Psychology

**My Focus**
- Mental Clarity

**Current Personal Experiment**
- I am trying to solve Rubik cubes in under 60 sec. My current pace is 90 sec ‚è≤Ô∏è

**My Brain Foods**
- [The school of Life ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog)
- [Farnam Street ](https://fs.blog/)
- [TED](https://www.ted.com/profiles/2897805)

**What do I do @Github**
- I believe that customer journeys should be unending and ever-evolving. I focus on building programs and strategies to give our customers a world-class customer experience at each stage of our lifecycle stages (onboarding, Activation, Adoption and loyalty, and Retention). Lifecycle Marketing is a new and evolving concept where we look at the customer journey not as a funnel but as a flywheel. 

- My approach to building a successful program is to build campaigns like experiments with intelligent automation and Data science. I have built marketing programs for Salesforce, AMEX, eBay, and now Github.

**Best way to communicate with me**
- Slack is ‚úîÔ∏è. I'm still getting used to the firehose that is GitHub notifications.
- If you want to chat face to face, feel free to just set up a time on my calendar, you don't have to ask me :)
